# Darwin

The code in the Darwin platform targets Apple platforms but is not specific
to iOS or OS X. This code is not distributed as an SDK in itself, but is required
by the [iOS](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/tree/master/platform/ios)
and [OS X](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/tree/master/platform/osx)
platforms.
