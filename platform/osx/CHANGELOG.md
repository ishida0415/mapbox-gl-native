# Changelog for Mapbox OS X SDK

## master

* This version of the Mapbox OS X SDK roughly corresponds to version 3.2.2 of the Mapbox iOS SDK. The two SDKs have very similar feature sets. The main difference is the lack of user location tracking. Some APIs have been adapted to OS X conventions, particularly the use of NSPopover for callout views.
